# The Zephyr.js Project

This purpose of this project is to provide a JavaScript API and environment
for IoT development on low-memory systems, using JerryScript and the Zephyr
operating system.

This code requires a local copy of JerryScript and Zephyr source, and we
will upstream code to those projects as appropriate, but this repo is for
everything else.

## File Descriptions
```zjs-env.sh``` - Source this file to set environment variables and path to be
able to use tools from ```scripts/``` anywhere.

## Subdirectories
- ```arc/``` - Contains sensor subsystem code for ARC side of the Arduino 101.
- ```deps/``` - Contains dependency repos and scripts for working with them.
- ```outdir/``` - Directory generated by build, can be safely removed.
- ```samples/``` - Sample JavaScript files that can be built with make JS=<path>.
- ```scripts/``` - Subdirectory containing tools useful during development.
- ```src/``` - JS API bindings for JerryScript written directly on top of Zephyr.
- ```test/``` - Zephyr applications that test various components.

## Setting up your environment
Download the [latest Zephyr SDK] (https://nexus.zephyrproject.org/content/repositories/releases/org/zephyrproject/zephyr-sdk/), then:
```
$ chmod +x zephyr-sdk-0.*.*-i686-setup.run
$ sudo ./zephyr-sdk-0.*.*-i686-setup.run
```

Next, set up the Zephyr SDK environment variables. It is recommended that you
add the following two lines to your ```.bashrc``` so that you don't have to type
them again. If you installed your Zephyr SDK elsewhere, adjust as needed.
```
$ export ZEPHYR_GCC_VARIANT=zephyr
$ export ZEPHYR_SDK_INSTALL_DIR=/opt/zephyr-sdk
```

To check out the other repos Zephyr.js is dependent on:

```
$ cd deps
$ ./getrepos
```

Later, to update them to the latest compatible code:
```
$ cd deps
$ ./update
```

Next, set up the Zephyr OS environment variables:
```
$ source deps/zephyr/zephyr-env.sh
```

If you wish to use a Zephyr tree elsewhere on your system, source its
zephyr-env.sh file instead.

Next, set up the Zephyr.js environment variables:
```
$ source zjs-env.sh
```

Note: If you are using Zephyr.js with an Arduino101 that you have converted to
a 256KB X86 partition (see below), you should pass 256 to this command:
```
$ source zjs-env.sh 256
```

The command will display the current expected partition size to remind you of
the expected target.

### JS Minifier

To save space it is recommended to use a minifier. In convert.sh, the script used
to encode your JS into a source file, we use uglifyjs. This can be downloaded by
doing:
```
sudo apt-get install node-uglify
```

## Getting more space on your Arduino 101
By default, Arduino 101 comes with a **144K** X86 partition, but we're able to
pretty safely increase it to **256K**. You should only use the ```dfu-util```
method of flashing after this.

The easiest way to do this is to use a flashpack.zip file that I can provide
you (geoff@linux.intel.com). I need to make sure of the license details before
I add it to the repo.

The default build settings currently expect you to be using the 256KB partition.

## Build the *Hello World* sample
```
$ make JS=samples/HelloWorld.js
```

This will build the system image, resulting in outdir/zephyr.bin as the final
output. To flash this to your device with dfu-util, first press the Master Reset
button on your Arduino 101, and about three seconds later type:

```
$ make flash
```

There is a window of about five seconds where the DFU server is available,
starting a second or two after the device resets.

## Build other samples
The other samples may require some hardware to be set up and connected; read
the top of each JS file, but then simply pass in the path to the JS file to make
as with ```HelloWorld.js``` above.

## Running JerryScript Unit Tests
```
$ cd apps/jerryscript_test/tests/
$ ./rununittest.sh
```

This will iterate through the unit test one by one. After each test completes,
press Ctrl-x to exit QEMU and continue with the next test.
